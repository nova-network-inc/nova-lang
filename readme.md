# Welcome to Novalang!
We have created Novalang to facilitate the development of Windows desktop-oriented applications for Nova Network. This is still under heavy development, and you might face bugs and glitches while using it.

# Usage
1) Clone the git directory using ```git clone``` https://github.com/nova-network-inc/nova-lang.git.  
2) Access your new app directory using ```cd nova-lang```.  
3) Create a new index file for your application using the command ```.\newIndex```.  
4) Once your new index file is created, you can use your preferred IDE to code it.  

* Remember to always start your files with ```CALL appStart``` on the first line of code.

# Building
You can build your application using the command ```.\build``` and specifying your index file path.

# Executing
Once built, you can execute your application by double-clicking the file ```Application.exe``` or using the command ```.\run``` on your terminal.
